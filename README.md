### MVP:

Create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament bracket from a list of names collected from the 
user.

### Planning: 

###### Programming
To take user a input, then store it in an array. Then the application needs to divide into two arrays, by pushing items in random order. 

###### UX  
I need to provide clear and intuitive visual guidance and ensure it's easy to use. 

###### UI 
App needs to be responsive and accessible. Needs to be enjoyable to use on a small device as well as a larger device. 

## Further Goals  

- Enable the user to set the size of the tournament.
- Create a more visually interesting way to show the fixtures. 
- The ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the   tournament playoffs
- A continutation of rounds generated until the final
