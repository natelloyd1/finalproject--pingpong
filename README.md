## How to set up

NPM and a Command Line tools used to do the following

1. Git clone this repo and *cd* into the project folder
2. Run *npm install*
3. Run *npm start* to view on localhost:3000 on browser

Or you can view the live app here - https://natelloyd1.github.io/finalproject--pingpong/

## Technologies and skills used: 

React, JSX, JavaScript, HTML, CSS & Git. 

### MVP:

Create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament bracket from a list of names collected from the 
user.

### Planning: 

###### Programming
To take user a input, then store it in an array. Then the application needs to divide into two arrays, by pushing items in random order. 

###### UX  
I need to provide clear and intuitive visual guidance and ensure it's easy to use. 

###### UI 
App needs to be responsive and accessible. Needs to be enjoyable to use on a small device as well as a larger device. 

## Further Goals  

- Enable the user to set the size of the tournament
- Create a more visually interesting way to show the fixtures
- The ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the   tournament playoffs
- A continutation of rounds generated until the final
- To show an error message if you press 'Create Teams' and you have the wrong amount of players added. It currently shows     the error message even after 1 player is added, when it's likely that the user knows they have to enter more

## Wireframes 

At first, I found it useful to sketch out the design on paper.

Then I used the application Pencil to create some basic wireframes.
